# Hand Digit Recognition using CNN with Keras

This project focuses on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras for hand digit recognition. The model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images and their corresponding labels.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Jupyter Notebook: If not installed, you can install it using the following command:
```
pip install jupyter
```

- Keras: If not installed, you can install it using the following command:
```
pip install keras
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.

2. Open Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:
```
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the `main.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

4. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the code and train the model.

## Model Test Accuracy

The model achieves an initial test accuracy of 97.96% when running for only one epoch. To improve the accuracy, you can increase the number of epochs. Experiment with different values to find the optimal number of epochs for your specific requirements.
